#version:2.0.0

! PREAMBLE !

The VortexdataNET TSQPF End User License Agreement (EULA) sets rules for
downloading and using the Teamspeak Query Plugin Framework (Later called
TSPQF). A copy of the most recent version of the EULA can be found at
"https://tsqpf.vortexdata.net/docs/docs/framework_eula".

! WARRANTY !

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,

THE SOFTWARE.

! MAIN CONTENT !

By accepting the TSQPF EULA, you verify that you agree to the collection
of some data of your TSQPF instance, which is being sent to
VortexdataNET. VortexdataNET will only use some of the collected
information for display on their official websites
(eg. https://tsqpf.vortexdata.net displays a total installs count) and
to locate bugs and issues of the TSQPF (by sending stack traces and
logs). The data is collected anonymously, with the exception of the
frameworks UUID, which is used as an internal identifier.

The following information will be collected:

    - TSQPF Exceptions
    - TSQPF Variables
    - Various TSQPF operations
    - TSQPF Logs
	- Operating System Information

The framework DOES NOT collect personal or confidential information about
other services not related to the TSQPF.

! WHY WE COLLECT INSTANCE DATA !

By tracking unhandled exceptions, we can identify and fix bugs faster
and more efficiently. You can opt-out of the exception reporting by
changing the 'enableExceptionReporting' config value in the
main.properties from 'true' to 'false'.

On the other hand we track information about when your instance
launches, when you install a new instance and more to have an idea
of how many servers are using the framework. Additionally, the total
count of installations, launches and co. is displayed on the TSQPF
website (https://tsqpf.vortexdata.net).

! ADDITIONAL INFORMATION !

You can accept the EULA by changing the "acceptEula" config value in
your main.properties file to "true".

If the EULA has changed after updating your framework, it will stop
the boot process and inform you about any changes.
