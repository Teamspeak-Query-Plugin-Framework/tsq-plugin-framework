! PREAMBLE !

The VortexdataNET TSQPF End User License Agreement (EULA) sets rules for
downloading and using the Teamspeak Query Plugin Framework (Later called
TSPQF). The most recent version of the EULA can be found at
"https://tsqpf.vortexdata.net/docs/framework_eula".

! MAIN CONTENT !

By accepting the TSQPF EULA, you verify that you agree to the collection
of some data of your TSQPF instance, which is being sent to
VortexdataNET. VortexdataNET will only use the collected information for
display on their official websites (eg. https://tsqpf.vortexdata.net
displays a total installs count) and to locate bugs and issues of the
TSQPF (by sending stack traces and logs).

The following information will be collected:

	- TSQPF RAM Usage
	- TSQPF CPU Usage
	- TSQPF Plugins in use
	- TSQPF Startups (Inlcuding Date and Time)
	- TSQPF Crashes (Inlcuding Date and Time)
	- TSQPF Reloads (Inlcuding Date and Time)
	- TSQPF Main config settings (/configs/main.properties)

! ADDITIONAL INFORMATION !

You can accept the EULA by changing the "acceptEula" config value in
your main.properties file to "true".

If the EULA has changed after updating your framework, it will stop
the boot process and inform you about any changes.
